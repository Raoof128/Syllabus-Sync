Scope: Home Page Refactor - Phase 1 & 2 & 3
Summary: Refactored `app/home/HomeClient.tsx` to reduce complexity and improve maintainability. Extracted logic into custom hooks: `useHomeUser`, `useSampleSeeding`, `useHomeData`, `useHomeEventListeners`, and `useHomeErrorBoundary`. Created new `features/home/hooks/` directory. Verified with lint, typecheck, tests, and build.
Files: Modified `app/home/HomeClient.tsx`. Created `features/home/hooks/*`, `features/home/types.ts`.
Verification: `npm run check` ✅ (lint, typecheck, 425/425 tests, build all pass).
Follow-ups: Continue refactoring other candidates if requested.
