/**
 * Guard for BA-0050 — completes the student ID removal.
 *
 * BA-0050 stopped collecting `profiles.student_id`, nulled the 16 stored values
 * and dropped the column. The removal was reported as complete. It was not: two
 * translation keys survived in every one of the 35 locale files,
 *
 *   validation.studentIdRequired  -> "Student ID is required"
 *   enterStudentIdDesc            -> "Enter your 8-digit student ID number"
 *
 * 70 orphaned strings in total, referenced by no code. They leak no data, but
 * they are the visible residue of a field this project no longer collects, and a
 * future contributor reading the locale files would reasonably conclude the field
 * still exists and wire it back up.
 *
 * This test fails on the state as shipped, which is the point: the earlier
 * "complete" claim rested on the column being gone rather than on a search for
 * what still mentioned it.
